title: "How do I back up my wallet?"

If you didn't backup your Keystore when you first used the wallet, you may go to the `Settings` > Select `the information logo of your wallet` > Select `Backup Keystore` > Enter your `private password`. After that, you can go ahead and save your Keystore JSON at your own choice or you can print a hardcopy of the Keystore JSON.
