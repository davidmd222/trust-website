title: "What is Trust Wallet?"
---

Trust Wallet is open source, secure, easy to use and compatible with different operating systems. It is a mobile app, which means you always carry it around and use it.

### Open source
- Full transparency, which means users can view the source code and how we handle data on client side. We do not store any private information, not in a vault and not in a distributed cloud server.
- Source code: [https://github.com/TrustWallet/trust-wallet-ios](https://github.com/TrustWallet/trust-wallet-ios)

### Backup & Security
- Users have full control of the private key. We do not store them, which means nobody else can exploit users’ private data. We will never access any of your information because we don’t even own them in the first place.
- Keep your private key secure with bank-level security
- Use FaceID, TouchID or conventional password to protect your investments
- Gain peace of mind knowing all web interactions are protected by military grade encryptions
- Provide a fully security audited system

### Ease of use
- Aim to design a simple and accessible wallet that can be used by anybody
- Aim to provide the best possible experience for users
- Send and request `ETH`
- Store and track ERC20 tokens and ERC223 tokens
- Check balance, transaction history, and other details

### Compatibility
- Access wallets across devices
- Easy to manage wallets (create/import)

> Most importantly, we have a strong and active development community and near real-time responses in our [Telegram Group](https://t.me/trustwallet).
