title: "What does "insufficient gas * price + value" means?"
---

The gas fee is paid for miners in the Ethereum network to process an transaction.

There are two cases in which you can get this error:

1. You want to send tokens and don't have enough ETH to pay for the gas fee. Send some ETH to your Trust Wallet to pay the gas fee.

2. If you want to send all the ETH you have in your Trust Wallet, you have to subtract the gas fee from the amount of ETH you are trying to send. For example, if you want to send 1 ETH, try to send 0,97 ETH.
