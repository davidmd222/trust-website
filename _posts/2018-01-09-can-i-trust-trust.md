Yes! Your private key is stored locally on the client-side and protected with many layers of security. On top of that, the wallet is also *open source* and provides a *complete security [audited](https://trustwalletapp.com/assets/trust-wallet-exec-checklist.pdf)*. We can never access any of your information because we donâ€™t even own them in the first place. Trust - Etheremum Wallet will always keep your data private and secure.
